## Beyond Wordds - Multimedia Lab Project

### University of Porto, Faculty of Engineering

This project, created for the "Laboratory of Multimedia" course at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, is an interactive web application that visualizes emotions in the form of a starry sky. Each star in the canvas represents a different emotion, with unique colors assigned to each emotion to enhance the visual experience.

### Overview

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a dynamic canvas where users can interact with the stars. Each star is generated randomly across the canvas with varying sizes and colors, correlating with different emotions like Happiness, Sadness, Excitement, and Thoughtfulness.

### Features

- **Color-Coded Emotions:** Each emotion is assigned a specific color. 
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can interact with the canvas, adding new stars.
- **Responsive Design:** The canvas adjusts to the browser window size, making the application suitable for various devices.

### Technical Details

- The star sizes are set to be random but within a controlled range to ensure visibility and aesthetic appeal.
- The application utilizes JavaScript event listeners for user interactions, creating a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- A custom algorithm ensures that the stars are spaced adequately apart, maintaining a balanced composition.

### Purpose and Learning Outcomes

This project serves as an exploration of combining programming skills with creative design in a multimedia context. It highlights the potential of using web technologies to create engaging and interactive visual experiences. Throughout the development process, a deep understanding of JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS3 was gained, along with an appreciation for design in multimedia applications.
